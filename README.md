In this repl I train my web scraping skills and combine the results with openai.

User can input any wikipedia link.
BeautifulSoup then picks <p> from there to find the text content, which is given to openai to summarize. 
Overall summary works well. Amount of tokens can be adjusted if results need to be longer.
